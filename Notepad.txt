Sorry to hear about your dad — hope he’s doing okay and gets better soon.

Hi Ritesh,

I hope you're doing well!

I'm reaching out from India, where I'm currently building a team of experienced professionals who are looking for remote, part-time opportunities. If there are any relevant openings within your network, I’d truly appreciate it if you could help connect them.

One of our key profiles includes:

Automation Test Engineer / Manual (Functional) Test Engineer with over 10 years of experience in the QA domain.

I’d be happy to share their resume for your consideration.

Please let me know if there's a chance we can collaborate, or if you’d be open to a quick chat.

Best regards,
Sri Sherwin

To push your latest build and changes to your GitHub repo and deploy to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Build your React app (if using Create React App):
npm run build


2. Add, commit, and push your changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy: latest premium UI/UX, hero, worship section, and theme updates"
git push

3. If you use the gh-pages branch for deployment (common for Create React App), deploy with:
npm install -g gh-pages
npm run build
gh-pages -d build


Or, if your package.json has a deploy script:

npm run deploy

4. Wait a minute, then refresh your site at https://srisritp2.github.io/jhf/ (use a private/incognito window to avoid cache).

If you use GitHub Actions for deployment:

Go to your repo’s Actions tab and make sure the latest workflow runs and succeeds.
If it fails, check the logs for errors.
